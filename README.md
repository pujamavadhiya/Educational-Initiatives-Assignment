# **Design Patterns Implementation**

This repository contains examples of six popular design patterns categorized into Behavioral, Creational, and Structural patterns. Each pattern is implemented with its respective use case and explained for better understanding.

## **Behavioral Design Patterns**

### **1. Memento Pattern**
The Memento Pattern is used to capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation. This pattern is helpful in providing "undo" functionality.

### **2. Observer Pattern**
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship where multiple observers are updated automatically when the subject's state changes.

## **Creational Design Patterns**

### **1. Abstract Factory Pattern**
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### **2. Builder Pattern**
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## **Structural Design Patterns**

### **1. Adapter Pattern**
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. It allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

### **2. Decorator Pattern**
The Decorator Pattern dynamically adds additional responsibilities to an object. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
